            Signaling Use Cases for Traffic Differentiation
              draft-bwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases-latest

Abstract

   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by
   informing the network which flows are more important and which
   packets within a flow are more important.  The differentiated service
   may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the
   sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of both
   the sender and the network.

   This document outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new
   signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements which
   enables different traffic treatment.

1.  Introduction

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominantly at the access network
   (e.g., radio access networks).  Users who are serviced via these
   networks use various hosts which run various applications; each
   having different connectivity needs for an optimal user experience.
   These needs are not frozen but change over time depending on the
   application and even depending on how an application is used (e.g.,
   user's preferences).

   The simple network diagram below shows where such bandwidth and
   performance constraints usually exist with a "B" (for Bottleneck).
   Other network bottlenecks may be experienced in other segments not
   shown in the figure, such as interconnection links or the
   infrastructure that hosts the service (e.g., flash crowds).  A
   bottleneck may be limited in time, present or not regular patters,
   etc.

   Complications that are induced by such phenomena may be eliminated by
   adequate dimensioning and upgrades.  However, such upgrades may not
   be always immediately possible or economically justified.

   Complementary mitigations are thus needed to soften these
   complications by introducing some collaboration between hosts and
   networks to adjust their behaviors.

   For traffic sent in either direction, the network network elements
   that terminate a bandwidth constraining link (or located few hops
   next to that element) can be fed with flow metadata.  Such
   augmentation allows those network elements to make autonomous
   decisions to prioritize, delay, or drop packets, especially when
   performing reactive resource management.  Absent such metadata, these
   network elements have no means to guide the enforcement of the
   reactive resource policy.

   There are several challenges with this metadata augmentation:

   *  for hosts: which data to share without privacy breach or lowering
      confidentiality.

   *  for network elements:

      -  Deciding which metadata to trust

      -  Tradeoff between the extra cost (including processing) vs.
         expected benefits

      -  Impact on the network operations

   The metadata signals from a content provider are more likely to be
   authentic (if adequate authorization/validation are in place) but the
   metadata signals from other hosts may be "wrong", undesired by the
   peer host, or maliciously contain improper metadata.  Attempts to
   automate identification of content providers have included HTTP
   "Host" header inspection and TLS SNI inspection which are expected to
   fail as encrypted SNI and privacy-enhancing proxies become more
   prevalent.  Another mechanism to authorize metadata signals from a
   content provider is to configure the ISP equipment with the content
   network's source IP addresses (or other labels that may be visible on
   the packets) and provide a differentiated service to the traffic that
   match these criteria.  However, such an arrangement may have
   scalability issues.  An approach to mitigate these issues is to limit
   the target contents networks and networks that would put in place
   these arrangements.  Such limitations would benefit large players
   (large ISPs and large content network) and disadvantages small
   players (and new players).  A more egalitarian approach would provide
   the same benefit to all parties -- large and small -- and also
   provide richer signaling to further improve user experience and
   metadata interoperability.  This would allow all parties to become
   part of the "Internet fast lane".

   The authorization problem exists with technologies as relatively
   simple as DiffServ and the problem persists with many other recently
   discussed metadata signaling mechanisms, including embedding
   information in the UDP payload ([I-D.draft-trammell-plus-spec]), UDP
   options ([I-D.draft-kaippallimalil-tsvwg-media-hdr-wireless]),
   overloading the IPv6 Flow Label
   ([I-D.draft-cc-v6ops-wlcg-flow-label-marking], and Hop-by-Hop
   Options.  One mechanism suggested occasionally is to encrypt or
   integrity protect the metadata with a key; such a key could be
   established using a signaling protocol, see Section 3.3.

   There is consensus that applications can benefit by signaling the
   network ([IAB], [ATIS]).  This document provides use-cases to further
   detail the need of such signaling.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Intentional Management:  network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  network reactions to congestion events, with
      very short to very long durations (e.g., varying wireless and
      mobile air interface conditions).

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Priority Between Flows (Inter-Flow)

   Certain flows being received by an host or by an application are less
   or more important than other flows.  For example, a host downloading
   a software update is generally considered less important than another
   host doing interactive audio/video or gaming.  By signaling the
   relative importance of flows to a network element (e.g., router,
   MASQUE proxy), the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows to
   best accomodate the needs of the various applications (on a single
   host) and between hosts on a network.

3.1.1.  Abuse and Constraints

   It is important that not every flow be prioritized; otherwise, the
   network devolves into the best-effort network that existed prior to
   metadata signaling.  It is a requirement that mechanisms exist to
   prevent this occurrence.  The mechanism might be simple, for example
   a cellular network might allow one flow from a subscriber to declare
   itself as important; other flows with that subscriber are denied
   attempts to prioritize themselves.  The mechanism might be more
   complex where authentication and authorization is performed by an
   enterprise network which, itself, decides which flows are important
   based on its policy and only the enterprise network communicates flow
   priorities to the ISP network.  The enterprise might prioritize
   certain users (e.g., IT staff, CEO), certain equipment (audio/video
   equipment in a conference room), or whatever its policies it might
   want.

3.1.1.1.  Interactive Media

   Examples: VoIP, gaming, virtual desktop.

   Requirement: Signal the flow needs low jitter and low delay.
   However, the network can only provide a limited amount of low jitter/
   low delay to each host, maybe as few as one.  This requires signaling
   feedback indicating that low jitter and low delay flows are already
   subscribed to other hosts.  In response, the user and the application
   will likely continue, occasionally re-attempting to get the desired
   quality of service from the network.

   Todo: this section on cooperation needs editing.

3.1.1.2.  Bulk Data Transfer

   Examples: backup/restore, software update, RSS feed update, email

   Requirement: Signal the flow as below best-effort.

3.2.  Priority Within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RTP] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between voice, video and data.  Today's video
   streaming is exclusively over TCP but will migrate to QUIC and
   eventually is likely to support unreliable transport ([RFC9221],
   [I-D.draft-kpugin-rush]).  With unreliable transport of video in RTP
   or QUIC, it is beneficial to differentiate the important video
   keyframes from other video frames.  Other applications such as gaming
   and remote desktop also benefit from differentiating their packets to
   the network.

   Many of these flows do not originate from a content provider's
   network.  Thus, the flows originate from an IP address that is not
   known before connection establishment, so there needs to be a way for
   the client to authorize the network elements to honor the metadata of
   those packets.

3.3.  Key Establishment

   Various proposals have suggested establishing a key to validate per-
   packet metadata or to decrypt per-packet metadata.  However, most
   proposals have not specified how this key would be established.  A
   signaling protocol from the receiving host to its ISP could establish
   such a key.  The host can then convey the key to the sending host to
   use to integrity protect or encrypt the per-packet metadata.

      Note: The CPU overhead of validating or decrypting such per-packet
      metadata needs to be carefully considered by the signaling
      protocol proposing such keying.

3.4.  Metadata Version/Capability Exchange

   The sender has to convey metadata in a way that is understood by the
   various network elements on the path -- each of which might be
   operated by different entities and have different capabilities.  For
   example, the Wi-Fi access point might be operated by an enterprise
   network, hotel, or home user, whereas the ISP's router is operated by
   the ISP.  Each of those might support different versions of the same
   metadata, or might need the metadata expressed in different ways.

   The signaling protocol would provide a way to learn the needs of
   those networks, and provide metadata signaling satisfying most or all
   of their needs.
