            Signaling Use Cases for Traffic Differentiation
              draft-bwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases-latest

Abstract

   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by
   informing the network which flows are more important and which
   packets within a flow are more important.  The differentiated service
   may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the
   server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both.

   This document outlines some use-cases and their requirements, and
   also explains deficiencies in existing standard mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Intentional Management:  network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  network reactions to congestion events, with
      very short to very long durations (e.g., varying wireless and
      mobile air interface conditions).

3.  Use Cases

   ## Priority Between Flows (Inter-Flow)

3.1.  Priority Within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RTP] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between vooice, video and data.

4.  Requirements

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
