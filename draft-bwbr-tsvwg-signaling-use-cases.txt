            Signaling Use Cases for Traffic Differentiation
              draft-bwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases-latest

Abstract

   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by
   informing the network which flows are more important and which
   packets within a flow are more important.  The differentiated service
   may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the
   sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of both
   the sender and the network.

   This document outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new
   signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements which
   enables different traffic treatment.

1.  Introduction

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominently at the access network.
   Users of those networks run various hosts which run various
   applications, each having different needs for the best user
   experience.  These requirements are not fixed but change over time
   depending on the application and even depending on how the
   application is used.

   The simple network diagram below shows where such bandwidth and
   performance constraints usually exist with a "B".

              +------+  |                     |          |
   +----+     |Wi-Fi |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
   |host+--B--+access+--B--+router+--+router+---+router+---+host|
   +----+     |point |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
              +------+  |                     |          |
                        |                     | Transit  |  Content
      User Network      |    ISP Network      | Network  |  Network

   A difficulty is traffic arriving from the content provider cannot be
   differentiated from other traffic arriving from other hosts on the
   Internet -- it is all incoming traffic.  But the receiving host would
   like to indicate the traffic's importance to the host (or to the
   application) to those bottleneck locations.  A solution to this
   problem is configuring the ISP equipment with the content network's
   source IP addresses and providing that traffic differentiated access.
   That differentiated access might be honoring the DSCP bits of the
   traffic, providing lower latency or jitter, assured bandwidth, or
   suchlike.  However such an arrangement benefits large players (large
   ISPs and large content network) but disadvantages small players and
   new players.  A more egalitarian approach would provide the same
   benefit to all parties -- large and small -- and also provide richer
   signaling to further improve user experience.  This allows all
   parties to become part of the "Internet fast lane".

   There is consensus that applications can benefit by signaling the
   network ([IAB], [ATIS]).  This document provides use-cases where such
   signaling is valuable.

1.1.  Everyone Is a Fire Engine

   While DiffServ is a candidates technology which meets many of the
   use-cases, the ISP's router has no reason to believe the DiffServ
   code points set by the remote host, especially as some hosts will set
   DSCP in an attempt to boost the speed of their traffic at the
   detriment of other traffic the receiving host considers more
   important.

   Other technologies being considered for host-to-network signaling
   suffer a similar problem as DiffServ: they need authorization from
   the receiving host, or else accidentally misconfigured senders or
   purposefully misbehaving senders will interfere with networks, or
   else only large ISPs and large CSPs will prevail.  These proposals
   include embedding information in the UDP payload
   ([I-D.draft-trammell-plus-spec]), UDP options
   ([I-D.draft-kaippallimalil-tsvwg-media-hdr-wireless]), overloading
   the IPv6 Flow Label ([I-D.draft-cc-v6ops-wlcg-flow-label-marking],
   and Hop-by-Hop Options.  Occasionally to provide the necessary
   authorization those specifications suggest establishing a key to
   mitigate against malicious use, see Section 3.3.

   Many approaches being considered today for host-to-network signaling
   have a similar

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Intentional Management:  network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  network reactions to congestion events, with
      very short to very long durations (e.g., varying wireless and
      mobile air interface conditions).

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Priority Between Flows (Inter-Flow)

   Certain flows being received by an host or by an application are less
   or more important than other flows.  For example, a host downloading
   a software update is generally considered less important than another
   host doing interactive audio/video or gaming.  By signaling the
   relative importance of flows to a network element (e.g., router,
   MASQUE proxy), the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows to
   best accomodate the needs of the various applications (on a single
   host) and between hosts on a network.

3.1.1.  Interactive Media

   Examples: VoIP, gaming, virtual desktop.

   Requirement: Signal the flow needs low jitter and low delay.
   However, the network can only provide a limited amount of low jitter/
   low delay to each host, maybe as few as one.  This requires signaling
   feedback indicating that low jitter and low delay flows are already
   subscribed to other hosts.  In response, the user and the application
   will likely continue, occasionally re-attempting to get the desired
   quality of service from the network.

   Todo: this section on cooperation needs editing.

3.1.1.1.  Bulk Data Transfer

   Examples: backup/restore, software update

   Requirement: Signal the flow

3.2.  Priority Within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RTP] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between voice, video and data.  When video streaming
   uses unreliable transport ([RFC9221]) as proposed by
   [I-D.draft-kpugin-rush] it is beneficial to differentiate the
   important video keyframes from other video frames.

   As these types of flows are received over the Internet -- and not
   from IP addresses known a priori -- there is no way to authorize
   using packet markings from some sources while not authorizing traffic
   markings from other sources.  In contrast, authorization is implicit
   when cooperating content providers are sending traffic that is known
   to be compliant with the ISP's expectations, and those traffic source
   IP addresses are known a priori.

   TODO.

3.3.  Key Establishment

   Various proposals have suggested establishing a key to validate per-
   packet metadata or to decrypt per-packet metadata.  However, most
   proposals have not specified how this key would be established.  A
   signaling protocol from the receiving host to its ISP could establish
   such a key.  The host can then convey the key to the sending host to
   use to integrity protect or encrypt the per-packet metadata.

      Note: The CPU overhead of validating or decrypting such per-packet
      metadata needs to be carefully considered by the signaling
      protocol proposing such keying.

3.4.  Metadata Version/Capability Exchange

   TODO.

   To be useful, the sender has to convey metadata in a way that is
   understood by the various network elements on the path -- which might
   be operated by different entities.  For example, the Wi-Fi access
   point might be operated by an enterprise network, hotel, or home
   user, whereas the ISP's router is operated by the ISP.  Each of those
   might support different versions of the same metadata, or might need
   the metadata expressed in different ways.

   The signaling protocol would provide a way to learn the needs of
   those networks, and provide metadata signaling satisfying most or all
   of their needs.
