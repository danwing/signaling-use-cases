            Signaling Use Cases for Traffic Differentiation
              draft-bwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases-latest

Abstract

   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by
   informing the network which flows are more important and which
   packets within a flow are more important.  The differentiated service
   may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the
   sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of both
   the sender and the network.

   This document outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new
   signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements which
   enables different traffic treatment.

1.  Introduction

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominently at the access network.
   Users of those networks run various hosts which run various
   applications, each having different needs for the best user
   experience.  These requirements are not fixed but change over time
   depending on the application and even depending on how the
   application is used.

   The simple network diagram below shows where such bandwidth and
   performance constraints usually exist with a "B".

              +------+  |                     |          |
   +----+     |Wi-Fi |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
   |host+--B--+access+--B--+router+--+router+---+router+---+host|
   +----+     |point |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
              +------+  |                     |          |
                        |                     | Transit  |  Peer's
      User Network      |    ISP Network      | Network  |  Network

   A difficulty is traffic arriving from the peer host (on the right)
   cannot be differentiated from other traffic arriving from other hosts
   on the Internet -- it all looks like incoming traffic.  But the
   receiving host would like to indicate the traffic's importance to the
   host (or to the application) to those bottleneck locations.

   While DiffServ and IntServ are initial candidates to solve the
   problem, the ISP's router has no reason to believe the DiffServ code
   points set by the remote host, especially as some hosts will set it
   incorrectly on purpose to boost the speed of their own traffic.  A
   mechanism for the host to signal its desire that received traffic
   receive differentiated treatment problem of undesired traffic from
   being given undesired priority treatment.  Instead, the client who is
   a subscriber of the ISP decides which incoming flows are important to
   the client.  IntServ suffers from the need for the remote peer to
   implement IntServ for the beenfit of the local network: this is a
   mis-aligned incentive and is among the reasons IntServ has not been
   deployed on the Internet.

   There is consensus that applications can benefit by signaling the
   network ([IAB], [ATIS]).  This document provides use-cases where such
   signaling is valuable.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Intentional Management:  network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  network reactions to congestion events, with
      very short to very long durations (e.g., varying wireless and
      mobile air interface conditions).

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Priority Between Flows (Inter-Flow)

   Certain flows being received by an host or by an application are less
   or more important than other flows.  For example, a host downloading
   a software update is generally considered less important than another
   host doing interactive audio/video or gaming.  By signaling the
   relative importance of flows to a network element (e.g., router,
   MASQUE proxy), the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows to
   best accomodate the needs of the various applications (on a single
   host) and between hosts on a network.

3.1.1.  Interactive Media

   Examples: VoIP, gaming, virtual desktop.

   Requirement: Signal the flow needs low jitter and low delay.
   However, the network can only provide a limited amount of low jitter/
   low delay to each host, maybe as few as one.  This requires signaling
   feedback indicating that low jitter and low delay flows are already
   subscribed to other hosts.  In response, the user and the application
   will likely continue, occasionally re-attempting to get the desired
   quality of service from the network.

   Todo: this section on cooperation needs editing.

3.1.1.1.  Bulk Data Transfer

   Examples: backup/restore, software update

   Requirement: Signal the flow

3.2.  Priority Within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RTP] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between voice, video and data.  When video streaming
   uses unreliable transport ([RFC9221]) as proposed by
   [I-D.draft-kpugin-rush] it is beneficial to differentiate the
   important video keyframes from other video frames.

   As these types of flows are received over the Internet -- and not
   from IP addresses known a priori -- there is no way to authorize
   using packet markings from some sources while not authorizing traffic
   markings from other sources.  In contrast, authorization is implicit
   when cooperating content providers are sending traffic that is known
   to be compliant with the ISP's expectations, and those traffic source
   IP addresses are known a priori.
