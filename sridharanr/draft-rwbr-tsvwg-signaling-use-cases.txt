            Signaling Use Cases for Traffic Differentiation
              draft-rwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases-latest

Abstract

   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by
   informing the network which flows are more important and which
   packets within a flow are more important.  The differentiated service
   may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the
   sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of both
   the sender and the network.

   This document outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new
   signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements which
   enables different traffic treatment.

1.  Introduction

   Bandwidth constraints exist most predominently at the access network.
   Users of those networks run various hosts which run various
   applications, each having different needs for the best user
   experience.  These requirements are not fixed but change over time
   depending on the application and even depending on how the
   application is used.

   The simple network diagram below shows where such bandwidth and
   performance constraints usually exist with a "B".

              +------+  |                     |          |
   +----+     |Wi-Fi |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
   |host+--B--+access+--B--+router+--+router+---+router+---+host|
   +----+     |point |  |  +------+  +------+ | +------+ | +----+
              +------+  |                     |          |
                        |                     | Transit  |  Content
      User Network      |    ISP Network      | Network  |  Network

   For traffic sent in either direction, the network network element(s)
   immediately prior to the bandwidth constraining link can be augmented
   with flow metadata.  Such augmentation allows those network elements
   to make autonomous decisions to prioritize, delay, or drop packets
   especially to when performing Reactive Management.

   A difficulty with this metadata augmentation is deciding which
   metadata to trust.  Traffic arriving from a content provider cannot
   be differentiated from traffic arriving from other hosts on the
   Internet.  The metadata signals from the content provider are more
   likely to be authentic but the metadata signals from other hosts may
   be wrong, undesired by the local host, or maliciously contain
   improper metadata.  Attempts to automate identification of content
   providers have included HTTP "Host" header inspection and TLS SNI
   inspection which are expected to fail as encrypted SNI and privacy-
   enhancin MASQUE proxies become more prevalant.  A remaining mechanism
   to authorize metadata signals from the content provider is to
   configure the ISP equipment with the content network's source IP
   addresses and provide only that traffic with differentiated service.
   However, such an arrangement benefits large players (large ISPs and
   large content network) and disadvantages small players (and new
   players).  A more egalitarian approach would provide the same benefit
   to all parties -- large and small -- and also provide richer
   signaling to further improve user experience and metadata
   interoperability.  This would allow all parties to become part of the
   "Internet fast lane".

   The authorization problem exists with technologies as relatively
   simple as DiffServ and the problem persists with many other recently
   discussed metadata signaling mechanisms including embedding
   information in the UDP payload ([I-D.draft-trammell-plus-spec]), UDP
   options ([I-D.draft-kaippallimalil-tsvwg-media-hdr-wireless]),
   overloading the IPv6 Flow Label
   ([I-D.draft-cc-v6ops-wlcg-flow-label-marking], and Hop-by-Hop
   Options.  One mechanism suggested occasionally is to encrypt or
   integrity protect the metadata with a key; such a key could be
   established with a signaling protocol, see Section 3.4.

   There is consensus that applications can benefit by signaling the
   network ([IAB], [ATIS]).  This document provides use-cases to further
   detail the need of such signaling.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Intentional Management:  network policy such as (monthly) bandwidth
      quota or bandwidth limit, or quality (delay and/or jitter))
      assurances.

   Reactive Management:  network reactions to congestion events, with
      very short to very long durations (e.g., varying wireless and
      mobile air interface conditions).

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Priority Between Flows (Inter-Flow)

   Certain flows being received by an host or by an application are less
   or more important than other flows.  For example, a host downloading
   a software update is generally considered less important than another
   host doing interactive audio/video or gaming.  By signaling the
   relative importance of flows to a network element (e.g., router,
   MASQUE proxy), the network element can (de-)prioritize those flows to
   best accomodate the needs of the various applications (on a single
   host) and between hosts on a network.

3.2.  Abuse and Constraints

   It is important that not every flow be prioritized; otherwise, the
   network devolves into the best-effort network that existed prior to
   metadata signaling.  It is a requirement that mechanisms exist to
   prevent this occurrence.  The mechanism might be simple, for example
   a cellular network might allow one flow from a subscriber to declare
   itself as important; other flows with that subscriber are denied
   attempts to prioritize themselves.  The mechanism might be more
   complex where authentication and authorization is performed by an
   enterprise network which, itself, decides which flows are important
   based on its policy and only the enterprise network communicates flow
   priorities to the ISP network.  The enterprise might prioritize
   certain users (e.g., IT staff, CEO), certain equipment (audio/video
   equipment in a conference room), or whatever its policies it might
   want.  The ISP can choose to limit the prioritization to a specified
   limit and choose to ignore metadata beyond the bandwidth.  This
   available bandwdith can be signaled through Network-to-Host data
   specified in [I-D.draft-rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata-latest].

3.3.  Priority Within a Flow (Intra-Flow)

   Interactive Audio/Video has long been using [RTP] which runs over
   UDP.  As described in Section 2.3.7.2 of [RFC7478], there is value in
   differentiating between voice, video and data.  Today's video
   streaming is exclusively over TCP but will migrate to QUIC and
   eventually is likely to support unreliable transport ([RFC9221],
   [I-D.draft-kpugin-rush]).  With unreliable transport of video in RTP
   or QUIC, it is beneficial to differentiate the important video
   keyframes from other video frames.  Other applications such as gaming
   and remote desktop also benefit from differentiating their packets to
   the network.

   Many of these flows do not originate from a content provider's
   network.  Thus, the flows originate from an IP address that is not
   known before connection establishment, so there needs to be a way for
   the client to authorize the network elements to honor the metadata of
   those packets.

3.4.  Key Establishment

   Various proposals have suggested establishing a key to validate per-
   packet metadata or to decrypt per-packet metadata.  However, most
   proposals have not specified how this key would be established.  A
   signaling protocol from the receiving host to its ISP could establish
   such a key.  The host can then convey the key to the sending host to
   use to integrity protect or encrypt the per-packet metadata.

      Note: The CPU overhead of validating or decrypting such per-packet
      metadata needs to be carefully considered by the signaling
      protocol proposing such keying.

3.5.  Metadata Version/Capability Exchange

   The sender has to convey metadata in a way that is understood by the
   various network elements on the path -- each of which might be
   operated by different entities and have different capabilities.  For
   example, the Wi-Fi access point might be operated by an enterprise
   network, hotel, or home user, whereas the ISP's router is operated by
   the ISP.  Each of those might support different versions of the same
   metadata, or might need the metadata expressed in different ways.

   The signaling protocol would provide a way to learn the needs of
   those networks, and provide metadata signaling satisfying most or all
   of their needs.

3.6.  Real-world Use cases

3.6.1.  Video Streaming

   Streaming video contains the occasional key frame ("i-frame")
   containing a full video frame.  These are necessary to rebuild
   receiver state after loss of delta frames.  The key frames are
   therefore more critical to deliver to the receiver than delta frames.

   Streaming video also contains audio frames which can be encoded
   separately and thus can be signaled separately.  Audio is more
   critical than video for almost all applications, but its importance
   (relative to other packets in the flow) is still an application
   decision.  In the example below, the audio is more important than
   video (importance=high, PT=keep, RU=reliable), video key frames have
   middle importance (importance=low, PT=discard, RU=reliable), and both
   types of video delta frames (P-frame and B-frame) have least
   importance (importance=low, PT=discard, RU=unreliable).

   Video Streaming Metadata:

        +===============+============+==============+============+
        |  Traffic type | Importance | PacketNature | PacketType |
        +===============+============+==============+============+
        | video I-frame |    low     |   realtime   |  reliable  |
        |  (key frame)  |            |              |            |
        +---------------+------------+--------------+------------+
        |  video delta  |    low     |   discard    | unreliable |
        |    P-frame    |            |              |            |
        +---------------+------------+--------------+------------+
        |  video delta  |    low     |   discard    | unreliable |
        |    B-frame    |            |              |            |
        +---------------+------------+--------------+------------+
        |     audio     |    high    |   realtime   |  reliable  |
        +---------------+------------+--------------+------------+

           Table 1: Example Values for Video Streaming Metadata

3.6.2.  Interactive Media

   Examples: VoIP, gaming.

   Requirement: Signal the flow needs low jitter and low delay.
   However, the network can only provide a limited amount of low jitter/
   low delay to each host, maybe as few as one.  This requires signaling
   feedback indicating that low jitter and low delay flows are already
   subscribed to other hosts.  In response, the user and the application
   will likely continue, occasionally re-attempting to get the desired
   quality of service from the network.

   In many scenarios a game or VoIP application will want to signal
   different metadata for the same type of packet in each direction.
   For example, for a game, video in the server-to-client direction
   might be more important than audio, whereas input devices (e.g.,
   keystrokes) might be more important than audio.

   Both gaming (video in both directions, audio in both directions,
   input devices from client to server) and interactive audio/video
   (VoIP, video conference) involves important traffic in both
   directions -- thus is a slightly more complicated use-case than the
   previous example.  Additionally, most Internet service providers
   constrain upstream bandwidth so proper packet treatment is critical
   in the upstream direction.

   Metadata:

   Based on metadata types listed in the
   [I-D.draft-rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata-latest], the host to network
   metadata parameters for interactive media type will as given below.

   Interactive A/V, downstream Metadata:

      +===================+============+==============+============+

      +-------------------+------------+--------------+------------+

          Table 3: Example Values for Interactive A/V, upstream

   Many interactive audio/video applications also support sharing the
   presenter's screen, file, video, or pictures.  During this sharing
   the presenter's video is less important but the screen or picture is
   more important.  This change of imporance can be conveyed in metadata
   to the network, as in the table below:

   Interactive A/V, upstream Metadata:

      +===================+============+==============+============+
      |    Traffic type   | Importance | PacketNature | PacketType |
      +===================+============+==============+============+
      |  video key frame  |    low     |   realtime   |  reliable  |
      +-------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
      | video delta frame |    low     |   discard    | unreliable |
      +-------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |       audio       |    high    |   realtime   |  reliable  |
      +-------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |  picture sharing  |    high    |   realtime   |  reliable  |
      +-------------------+------------+--------------+------------+

         Table 4: Example Values for Interactive A/V with picture
                            sharing, upstream

   In many scenarios a game or VoIP application will want to signal
   different metadata for the same type of packet in each direction.
   For example, for a game, video in the server-to-client direction
   might be more important than audio, whereas input devices (e.g.,
   keystrokes) might be more important than audio.

   Todo: this section on cooperation needs editing.

3.6.3.  Bulk Data Transfer

   Examples: backup/restore, software update, RSS feed update, email,
   printing to a print server

   Requirement: Signal the flow as below best-effort.

   Metadata:

   +==============+============+==============+============+==========+
   | Traffic type | Importance | PacketNature | PacketType | Comments |
   +==============+============+==============+============+==========+
   |  File copy   |    low     |     bulk     |  reliable  |          |
   +--------------+------------+--------------+------------+----------+
   |   Printing   |    high    |     bulk     |  reliable  |          |
   +--------------+------------+--------------+------------+----------+

                                 Table 5

3.6.4.  Mixed Traffic

   Examples: Desktop Virtualization, Office software in the cloud
   (editing local files, typing is interactive while save operation is
   bulk transfer)

   Requirement: Signal flow will vary depending on the nature of the
   packet.  With variety of traffic going through the session, some
   packets can contain interactive traffic while the others contain bulk
   transfer.  There can be combination of reliable and unreliable
   traffic within the same session through multiple streams.  Host-to-
   network signaling plays a vital role in effectively routing mixed
   traffic for ideal user interactivity and network performance.

   Example packet metadata for Desktop Virtualization (like Citrix
   Virtual Apps and Desktops - CVAD) application.  This is shown in two
   tables, client-to-server traffic (Table 6) and server-to-client
   traffic (Table 7).

         Table 7: Example Values for Remote Desktop Virtualization
                         Metadata, server to client

   *** A video key frame should be handled differently by the network
   depending on a streaming application versus a remote desktop
   application.  The video streaming application's primary and only
   nature of traffic is video and audio.  In contrast, a remote desktop
   application might be playing a video and its associated audio while
   at the same time the user is editing a document.  The user's
   keystrokes and those glyphs need to be prioritized over the video
   lest the user think their inputs are being ignored (and type the same
   characters again).  Hence, the values are different even for the same
   nature of traffic but a different application.
